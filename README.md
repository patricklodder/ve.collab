# Collaborative solution engineering

This repository aims to be a place for Dogecoin enthusiasts
to collaborate on hardware engineering, integration and
working together on end-to-end open-source solutions.

This space is under heavy construction, but feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github.com/veryengineer/collab/discussions)
in the meantime.

### Meetings

We'll try to hold as many meetings as desired. Feel free to run your own!

You can find the archives of past meetings
[here](https://github.com/veryengineer/collab/wiki/Meetings).

### SBC Research

A list of SBCs and test results can be found
[at the wiki](https://github.com/veryengineer/collab/wiki/SBCs).
